<!--
(2) Make a simple html page that uses jQuery to manage Todos. It should have an input field. When the user enters text 
in the input field, show that input in the page. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page. 


I can tell you about some of the things that need to happen in this program, but I do not know enough javascript or html to write it myself.
I could have copied and pasted a solution that I found online, but for this assignment I don't think taking someone elses code is appropriate; 
this should demonstrate what I know, and how I think.  I applied for this camp because these are the things that I want to learn, and I learn best 
talking, watching, and working interactively with other people.


The two major parts of code on this page will be the HTML and the Javascript. 
The HTML will first set up the page with the basics tags.  Additionally, there will be an input tag that will display a place for the user to enter an item onto the todo list. -->
<html>
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
 	<input></input>

 	<script>
 	 /*In the javascript/ jquery script, there will be two event handlers.  The first will be a function that gets called when presses return after typing in the input box.  It's purpose is to add the entry to the todo list.  The second event handler will do just the opposite; it will be a function that gets called when you perform an action signifying you've completed an item on the list (for example, checking it off).  This event handler will remove that item from the list. */
